## Copyright

Copyright is a very important part of standardization activities. It allows the standards development organization to maintain vendor neutral control over a specification, and thus protect the consensus found within a Working Group.

In the course of the development of materials within the W3C, Task Force Participants will make contributions. Those contributions will be integrated into the jointly developed work thus creating shared copyright on the Task Force Participant's contribution. Most W3C Specifications contain a section with acknowledgement of contributions.

Task Force Participants grant to the W3C a perpetual, nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide right and license under any Task Force Participant's copyrights on his or her contributions, to copy, publish and distribute the contribution under a license of W3C's choosing. Additionally, the Task Force Participant grants a right and license of the same scope to any derivative works prepared by the W3C and based on, or incorporating all or part of, his or her contribution and that any derivative works of this contribution prepared by the W3C shall be solely owned by the W3C. Furthermore, the Task Force Participant understands that W3C will be able to exercise all rights as a copyright owner of Task Force Participant's contribution, including enforcement against infringers without additional agreement or notice.

Nothing in this agreement restricts the Task Force Participant from using their individual contributions as they wish, even if those have later been amalgamated into joint works. Where W3C releases materials under a permissive license such as the W3C Software License or CC-BY, nothing in this agreement should be read to restrict the Task Force Participant from exercising the permissions granted by that license. The Task Force Participant represents that they are legally entitled to grant the above license. If their employer(s) have rights to intellectual property that the Task Force Participant creates that includes the contributions, they represent that they have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer or that the employer has waived such rights for the contributions to W3C.


## Decency

The Task Force Participant will participate in the W3C Group in a decent way. Task Force Participants will refrain from defaming, harassing or otherwise offending other participants. The [Section 3.1 of the Process Document](https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#ParticipationCriteria) applies, as does the W3C [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).

The Task Force Participant will refrain from sending unsolicited commercial messages to W3C mailing-lists and other promotional activities for personal matters or for third parties. This is especially required from Task Force Participants sending messages to public W3C Groups.
