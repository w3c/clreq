    <p>This document describes and prioritises gaps for the support of Simplified and Traditional Chinese on the Web and in eBooks. In particular, it is concerned with text layout. It checks that needed features are supported in W3C specifications, in particular HTML and CSS and those relating to digital publications. It also checks whether the features have been implemented in browsers and ereaders. This document complements the document <a href="https://w3c.github.io/clreq/">Requirements for Chinese Text Layout</a>, which describes the requirements for areas where gaps appear. It is linked to from the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html">language matrix</a> that tracks Web support for many languages.</p>
<p>The editor's draft of this document is being developed by the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/clreq/">Chinese Layout Task Force</a>, part of the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/ig/">Internationalization Interest Group</a>. It is published by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/core/">Internationalization Working Group</a>. The end target for this document is a Working Group Note.</p>
</div>

  <section id="h_introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The W3C needs to make sure that the  needs of scripts and languages around the world are built in to technologies such as HTML, CSS, SVG, etc. so that Web pages and eBooks can look and behave as people expect around the world.</p>
<p>This page documents difficulties people encounter when trying to use the Chinese languagein both Simplified and Traditional scripts on the Web. </p>
<p>Having identified an issue, it investigates the current status with regards to web specifications and implementations by user agents (browsers, e-readers, etc.), and attempts to prioritise the severity of the issue for web users.  </p>
<p>A summary of this report and others can be found as part of the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html" style="font-size: 140%;">language matrix</a>.</p>
    
    <section id="workflow">
    <h3>Work flow</h3>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 140%;">This version of the document is a preliminary analysis</span></p>

    <p>Gap analysis work usually starts with a <strong>preliminary analysis</strong>, conducted quickly by one or a small group of experts. Then a more <strong>detailed analysis</strong> is carried out, involving a wider range of experts. The detailed analysis may involve the development of tests, in order to illustrate issues and track results for browsers. The next phase is <strong>ongoing maintenance</strong>. It is expected that the resulting document will not be frozen: as gaps are fixed, this should be noted in the document. It is also possible that new gaps are noticed or arise, and they can be added to this document when that happens.</p>
    
    <p>As the gap analysis develops, the requirements for features that are problematic should be described in the companion document, <a href="https://w3c.github.io/clreq/">Requirements for Chinese Text Layout</a>. Links to the appropriate part of that document should be added to this document as the material is created. Note that the requirements document should not contain any technology-specific information: all of that belongs here.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="prioritization">
    <h3>Prioritization</h3>
    <p>This document not only describes gaps, it also attempts to prioritise them in terms of the impact on the local user. The prioritisation is indicated by colour.</p>
        
        <p>Key:</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li class="ok"></li>
        <li class="na"></li>
        <li class="advanced"></li>
        <li class="basic"></li>
        <li class="broken"></li>
        <li class="tbd"></li>
        </ul>
    
    <p>It is important to note that these colours do not indicate to what extent a particular features is broken. They indicate the impact of a broken or missing feature on the content author or end user.</p>
    <p>Basic styling is the level that would be generally accepted as sufficient for most Web pages. Advanced level support would include additional features one might expect to include in ebooks or other advanced typographic formats. There may be features of a script or language that are not supported on the Web, but that are not generally regarded as necessary (usually archaic or obscure features). In this case, the feature can be described here, but the status should be marked as OK.</p>
    <p>The decision as to what priority level is assigned to a described gap is down to the experts doing the gap analysis. It may not always be straightforward to decide. If a given section in this document refers to more than one feature that is broken, each with different impacts on Web users, the priority for the section should be the lowest denominator.</p>
    <p>A cell can be scored as OK if the feature in question is specified in an appropriate specification, and is supported by user agents. A specification that is in CR or later and has two implementations in 'major' browsers will count. This means that the feature may not be supported in all browsers yet. (At some point in the future we may try to distinguish, visually, whether support is available in a specification but still pending in major browsers or applications.) </p>

<section id="quotations" class="advanced">
<h3>Quotations</h3>
<p id="prompt-quotations" class="status_prompt promptStub"></p>


    <section id="q_defaults">
    <h4><a href="#q_defaults">Default quotation marks for q element</a></h4>
    <p>If the <code class="kw" translate="no">html</code> tag sets the language of a page, the HTML specification says that  the <code class="kw" translate="no">q</code> element should by default produce quotation marks according to the information in CLDR for that language.</p>
    <p>For Traditional Chinese, according to CLDR the default quote marks should be 「...」, and embedded quote marks 『...』; for Simplified Chinese, according to CLDR the default quote marks should be “...”, and embedded quote marks ‘...’. Some browsers don't change default quote marks based on language setting. See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-tests/results/the-q-element.html#language">tests and results</a>.</p>
    </section>


    <section id="q_section">
    <h4><a href="#q_section">Default quotation marks in a new language section</a></h4>
    <p>In addition, the default quotation marks for the <code class="kw" translate="no">q</code> element  are not set to the appropriate characters by the browser  when the element appears inside a Chinese section of a page that has a different overall language. This is currently per the HTML specification (both W3C and WHATWG).  There is <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/3636">an issue</a> raised against the WHATWG version for this to be changed.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="q_multilingual">
        <h4><a href="#q_multilingual">Embedded quotations in a different language</a></h4>
        <p>Chinese quotes embedded in text in another language can also be problematic if the outer language uses different quotation marks. This is due to the browsers choosing default quotation marks based on the language of the <em>quotation</em>, rather than that of the surrounding text. See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-tests/results/the-q-element.html#ml_nesting">a test</a>. This behaviour is specified in the WHATWG version of the HTML spec, but no longer in the W3C version. There is <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/3636">an issue</a> raised against the WHATWG version for this to be changed.</p>
    </section>

    <p>Marking all the above as advanced, because use of the <code class="kw" translate="no">q</code> element is optional (quote characters can be used instead), and it can be styled using CSS for the general case.</p>
