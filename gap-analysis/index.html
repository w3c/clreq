  <section id="h_introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>The W3C needs to make sure that the text layout and typographic needs of scripts and languages around the world are built in to technologies such as HTML, CSS, SVG, etc. so that Web pages and eBooks can look and behave as people expect around the world.</p>

  <p>This page documents issues for a given script or language in terms of support by specifications or user agents (browsers, e-readers, etc.). </p>
<p>A summary of this report and others can be found as part of the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html">language matrix</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 140%;">This version of the document is a preliminary analysis</span>.</p>

    <section id="workflow">
    <h3>Work flow</h3>
    <p>Gap analysis work usually starts with a <strong>preliminary analysis</strong>, conducted quickly by one or a small group of experts. Then a more <strong>detailed analysis</strong> is carried out, involving a wider range of experts. The detailed analysis may involve the development of tests, in order to illustrate issues and track results for browsers. The next phase is <strong>ongoing maintenance</strong>. It is expected that the resulting document will not be frozen: as gaps are fixed, this should be noted in the document. It is also possible that new gaps are noticed or arise, and they can be added to this document when that happens.</p>

    <p>As the gap analysis develops, the requirements for features that are problematic should be described in the companion document, <a href="https://w3c.github.io/clreq/">Requirements for Chinese Text Layout</a>. Links to the appropriate part of that document should be added to this document as the material is created. Note that the requirements document should not contain any technology-specific information: all of that belongs here.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="prioritization">
    <h3>Prioritization</h3>
    <p>This document not only describes gaps, it also attempts to prioritise them in terms of the impact on the local user. The prioritisation is indicated by colour.</p>

        <p>Key:</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li class="ok"></li>
        <li class="na"></li>
        <li class="advanced"></li>
        <li class="basic"></li>
        <li class="broken"></li>
        <li class="tbd"></li>
        </ul>

    <p>It is important to note that these colours do not indicate to what extent a particular features is broken. They indicate the impact of a broken or missing feature on the content author or end user.</p>
    <p>Basic styling is the level that would be generally accepted as sufficient for most Web pages. Advanced level support would include additional features one might expect to include in ebooks or other advanced typographic formats. There may be features of a script or language that are not supported on the Web, but that are not generally regarded as necessary (usually archaic or obscure features). In this case, the feature can be described here, but the status should be marked as OK.</p>
    <p>The decision as to what priority level is assigned to a described gap is down to the experts doing the gap analysis. It may not always be straightforward to decide. If a given section in this document refers to more than one feature that is broken, each with different impacts on Web users, the priority for the section should be the lowest denominator.</p>
    <p>A cell can be scored as OK if the feature in question is specified in an appropriate specification, and is supported by user agents. A specification that is in CR or later and has two implementations in 'major' browsers will count. This means that the feature may not be supported in all browsers yet. (At some point in the future we may try to distinguish, visually, whether support is available in a specification but still pending in major browsers or applications.) </p>

<section id="direction">
    <h2>Text direction</h2>
<p>See also General page layout &amp; progression for features such as column layout, page turning direction, etc. that are affected by text direction.</p>

<section id="vertical" class="basic">
<h3>Vertical text</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Are the script requirements for vertically oriented text met?  What about if you mix vertical text with scripts that are normally only horizontal? Do you need a switch to use different characters in vertical vs. horizontal text? Does the browser support short runs of horizontal text in vertical lines (tate-chu-yoko in Japanese) as expected? Is the orientation of characters and the directional ordering of characters supported as needed? <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#vertical_text">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Avertical-text%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>



    <section>
        <h4>Vertical form controls</h4>
        <p>One major gap is handling of vertical text in forms. Only the <span class="pass">Firefox</span> desktop browser does a good job of this. <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/tests/repo/results/writing-mode-vertical#rl_forms">See test results</a>. <span class="fail">Other browsers</span> fail resoundingly in terms of orienting form controls vertically and displaying text vertically inside them. More Tests: <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-drafts/articles/vertical-text/index-data/vertical-form.html" target="text">standard syntax</a> • <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-drafts/articles/vertical-text/index-data/vertical-form-pref.html" target="text">proprietary syntax</a></p>
        <p>This has a significant impact for creation of general web sites.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h4>Upright text orientation</h4>
        <p>Another gap is the CSS <code class="kw" translate="no">text-orientation</code> property. It is only supported as standard by <span class="pass">Firefox</span>. <span class="partial">Safari</span> has buggy support if you use the <code class="kw" translate="no">-webkit</code> proprietary extension: it has  a problem centering the letter in the vertical line. Tests:  <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-drafts/articles/vertical-text/index-data/upright-i.html" target="text">standard syntax</a> • <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-drafts/articles/vertical-text/index-data/upright-i-pref.html" target="text">proprietary syntax</a></p>
        <p>Upright-oriented Latin text, especially, is used commonly for acronyms in Chinese vertical text, so this is a significant gap for general web content.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h4>Horizontal-in-vertical (tate-chu-yoko)</h4>
        <p>The CSS <code class="kw" translate="no">text-combine-upright</code> property works with the <code class="kw" translate="no">all</code> value in all major browsers, although for <span class="partial">Edge</span> you need to use the proprietary property <code class="kw" translate="no">-ms-text-combine-horizontal</code>. Tests:  <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-drafts/articles/vertical-text/index-data/tcu-all.html" target="text">standard syntax</a> • <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-drafts/articles/vertical-text/index-data/tcu-all-pref.html" target="text">proprietary syntax</a></p>
        <p>With the <code class="kw" translate="no">digits</code> value, it is only supported by <span class="partial">Edge</span> (with it's proprietary property name), but Edge stretches single digits to fit the width of the (vertical) line. Tests: <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-drafts/articles/vertical-text/index-data/digits.html" target="text">standard syntax</a> • <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-drafts/articles/vertical-text/index-data/digits-pref.html" target="text">proprietary syntax</a></p>
        <p>The unavailability of the <code class="kw" translate="no">digits</code> value is an inconvenience, since more interventions and markup are needed when using the <code class="kw" translate="no">all</code> value.</p>

        <h4>Lists</h4>
        <p>To be written.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h4>Logical properties and values</h4>
        <p>A great deal of time and confusion can be saved by using 'logical' properties, rather than right, left, top and bottom, for things such as alignment. </p>
        <p>CSS is developing the necessary keywords in the <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-logical/">Logical Properties and Values</a> specification, which at the time of writing is still an editor's draft. Some of the properties described there, however, are already supported by browsers.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, Microsoft <span class="fail">Edge</span> still doesn't support the start and end values for text-align</p>
        <p>Tests: <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-drafts/articles/vertical-text/index-data/text-align-end.html" target="text">standard syntax</a> • <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-drafts/articles/vertical-text/index-data/text-align-end-pref.html" target="text">proprietary syntax</a></p>

    <p class="status_prompt">This is about how text is divided into graphemes, words, sentences, etc., and behaviour associated with that. Do Unicode grapheme clusters appropriately segment character units for your script? When you double- or triple-click on the text, is the expected range of characters highlighted? When you move through the text with the cursor, or backspace, etc. do you see the expected behaviour?  (Some of the answers to these questions may be picker up in other sections, such as line-breaking, or initial-letter styling.)   <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#graphemes">See available information</a>  or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aboundaries%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

<section id="textdecor" class="advanced">
    <h3>Text decoration</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">This is about  ways of marking text (see also specific sections dedicated to quotations and inline notes/annotations). Is it possible to express emphasis or highlight content as expected? Bold, italic and under-/over-lines are not always appropriate, and some scripts have their own unique ways of doing things, that are not in the Western tradition at all. Text delimiters mark certain items or sections off from the main text, such as book names in Chinese, quotations, head markers in Tibetan, etc, and often involve the use of punctuation. Is there any behaviour that isn't well supported, such as overlines for numeric digits in Syriac?    Are there issues about the positioning or use of underlines? Some aspects related to the drawing of lines alongside or through text involve local typographic considerations. Do underlines need to be broken in special ways for this script? Do you need support for additional line shapes or widths? Does the distance or position of the lines relative to the text need to vary in ways that are not achievable? Are lines correctly drawn relative to vertical text?  <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#text_decoration">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Atext-decoration%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


    <p>Punctuations are not skipped by default for emphasis marks.</p>
    <p>Chrome, Firefox, and Safari support emphasis dots. However, in Chrome the text emphasis properties needs to be prefixed by <code>-webkit-</code>.

</section>



<section id="quotations" class="advanced">
    <h3>Quotations</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Are there any issues when dealing with quotations marks, especially when nested? Should block quotes be indented or handled specially? <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#quotations">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aquotations%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


    <section id="q_defaults">
    <h4><a href="#q_defaults">Default quotation marks for q element</a></h4>
    <p>If the <code class="kw" translate="no">html</code> tag sets the language of a page, the HTML specification says that  the <code class="kw" translate="no">q</code> element should by default produce quotation marks according to the information in CLDR for that language.</p>
    <p>For Traditional Chinese, according to CLDR the default quote marks should be 「...」, and embedded quote marks 『...』; for Simplified Chinese, according to CLDR the default quote marks should be “...”, and embedded quote marks ‘...’. Some browsers don't change default quote marks based on language setting. See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-tests/results/the-q-element.html#language">tests and results</a>.</p>
    </section>


    <section id="q_section">
    <h4><a href="#q_section">Default quotation marks in a new language section</a></h4>
    <p>In addition, the default quotation marks for the <code class="kw" translate="no">q</code> element  are not set to the appropriate characters by the browser  when the element appears inside a Chinese section of a page that has a different overall language. This is currently per the HTML specification (both W3C and WHATWG).  There is <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/3636">an issue</a> raised against the WHATWG version for this to be changed.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="q_multilingual">
        <h4><a href="#q_multilingual">Embedded quotations in a different language</a></h4>
        <p>Chinese quotes embedded in text in another language can also be problematic if the outer language uses different quotation marks. This is due to the browsers choosing default quotation marks based on the language of the <em>quotation</em>, rather than that of the surrounding text. See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-tests/results/the-q-element.html#ml_nesting">a test</a>. This behaviour is specified in the WHATWG version of the HTML spec, but no longer in the W3C version. There is <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/3636">an issue</a> raised against the WHATWG version for this to be changed.</p>
    </section>

    <p>Marking all the above as advanced, because use of the <code class="kw" translate="no">q</code> element is optional (quote characters can be used instead), and it can be styled using CSS for the general case.</p>

<h2>Lines and Paragraphs</h2>


<section id="linebreak" class="advanced">
    <h3>Line breaking</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Does the browser capture the rules about the way text in your script wraps when it hits the end of a line? Does line-breaking wrap whole 'words' at a time, or characters, or something else (such as syllables in Tibetan and Javanese)?  What characters should not appear at the end or start of a line, and what should be done to prevent that? <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#line_breaking">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aline-break%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

<section id="hyphenation" class="ok">
    <h3>Hyphenation</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Is hyphenation used for your script, or something else? If hyphenation is used, does it work as expected? (Note, this is about line-end hyphenation when text is wrapped, rather than use of the hyphen and related characters as punctuation marks.) <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#hyphenation">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Ahyphenation%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


    <p>Chinese characters don't use hyphenation, but pinyin might use it.</p>

    <h3>Text alignment &amp; justification</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt"> When text in a paragraph needs to have flush lines down both sides, does it follow the rules for your script? Does the script need assistance to conform to a grid pattern? Does your script allow punctuation to hang outside the text box at the start or end of a line? Where adjustments are need to make a line flush, how is that done? Do you shrink/stretch space between words and/or letters? Are word baselines stretched, as in Arabic? What about paragraph indents, or the need for logical alignment keywords, such as start/end, rather than left/right? <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#justification">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Ajustification%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

<section id="pagelayout" class="tbd">
    <h3>General page layout &amp; progression</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">How are the main text area and ancilliary areas positioned and defined? Are there any special requirements here, such as dimensions in characters for the Japanese kihon hanmen? The book cover for scripts that are read right-to-left scripts is on the right of the spine, rather than the left. Is that provided for? When content can flow vertically and to the left or right, how do you specify the location of objects, text, etc. relative to the flow? For example, keywords 'left' and 'right' are likely to need to be reversed for pages written in English and page written in Arabic. Do tables and grid layouts work as expected? How do columns work in vertical text? Can you mix block of vertical and horizontal text correctly? Does text scroll in the expected direction? <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#direction_agnostic">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Abidi%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

<section id="morepage" class="ok">
    <h3>Other page layout &amp; pagination features</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Some cultures define text areas and page progression direction very differently from those in the West (eg. kihon hanmen in Japanese). Is this an issue for you?
